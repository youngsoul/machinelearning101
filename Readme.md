# Introduction to Machine Learning from an App Dev Perspective

The purpose of this repo of Jupyter Notebooks is to put in one place a collection of my notes, exercises and understanding of Machine Learning.  I find it helpful in my learning process to create *teaching material* as a way to solidify my understanding.

The notebooks follow an order, however any un-numbered notebook is either standalone, or has not yet but put into the notebook order.

The repo is very much a work in progress and probably will be for some time to come.

## Resources Used

"If I have seen further it is by standing on ye shoulders of giants" - Sir Isaac Newton, 1675

And so it is with this material as I have collected and summarized material from a number of other sources as I have been going through my Machine Learning journey.


I have brought together material from multiple sources:

### DataSchool.io
*From the video series: [Introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn](https://github.com/justmarkham/scikit-learn-videos)*

The owner, Kevin Markham, has a great video series along with accompanying Jupyter notebooks.  I have taken his [Machine Learning with Text in Python](http://www.dataschool.io/learn/) which I thought was well worth it.

### Alyssa Batula, PyLadies Remote presentation
- Alyssa gave a great overview of machine learning.  You can see that on [YouTube - Introduction to Machine Learning in Python with Alyssa Batula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BIGzKmxMGY).
- You can find her material on [GitHub](https://github.com/abatula/MachineLearningIntro)

### Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: A Guide for Data Scientists
- Book by Andreas Muller and Sarah Guido is a very consumeable guide to machine learning with great insight into the field.

- You can find that on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Machine-Learning-Python-Scientists/dp/1449369413/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1511371961&sr=8-2&keywords=machine+learning+oreilly).

## Setup ##

It is recommended that you setup a virtualenv for this project before installing the libraries.

`python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`

`source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate`


This lab assumes Python 3.6.x and that the following libraries have been installed:

* pip install scipy
* pip install scikit-learn
* pip install jupyter
* pip install matplotlib
* pip install pandas
* pip install seaborn
* pip install requests

`pip install scipy scikit-learn jupyter matplotlib pandas seaborn requests`

## Jupyter Notebook ##

To run the jupyter notebook after activating your virtual environment execute the following on the command line:

`jupyter notebook`
